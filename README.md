# Predictive Healthcare Insights: Machine Learning Approaches for Disease Diagnosis

## Description

The primary objective of this research is to develop a machine learning-based web application capable of predicting diseases based on user-reported symptoms. This project aims to explore and apply various machine learning techniques to enhance predictive accuracy and user experience in healthcare diagnostics.

The Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning project is an innovative web application developed with Streamlit. It harnesses advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms to accurately predict potential diseases based on user-provided symptoms.

This project represents an Internship Project under [Innovians Technologies](https://innovianstechnologies.com/), aimed at deepening insights into machine learning applications in predictive healthcare.

## Features

- **Number of Diseases Predictable**: The application can classify up to 42 different diseases.
- **Selectable Values**: Users can choose from 132 different symptom values.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Easily select symptoms and receive instant disease predictions.
- **Classifier Algorithm**: Utilizes a Logistic Regression classifier for accurate predictions.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Streamlit-powered interface ensures simplicity and accessibility.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Get immediate disease predictions as symptoms are selected.

## Technical Details

**Dataset (Data Source)**: Utilizes a curated dataset of symptoms and diseases for training the machine learning model. For dataset details, refer to [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning).

**Models Trained**:
- **Logistic Regression**: Implemented in the Streamlit application.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Trained but not integrated into the current Streamlit app.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Trained but not integrated into the current Streamlit app.

## Usage

The application functions by inputting selected symptoms into a trained machine learning model, which computes disease probabilities or classifications based on the symptom inputs.

For installation and utilization of the model, refer to or download the [Model](https://github.com/Neelkanth-khithani/Disease-Prediction-Using-ML/blob/main/model_app.py).

**Deployed Streamlit Link for Usage**: [Disease Prediction Web App](https://disease-prediction-using-ml-neelkanth.streamlit.app/)


## Future Improvements

Future enhancements may include:

- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Refinement of visual aesthetics and user interface to optimize user experience.
- **Integration with Health APIs**: Connecting with external health data APIs to enhance disease prediction accuracy.
- **User Accounts and History**: Implementing features for users to store symptom history and past predictions.
- **Advanced Machine Learning Models**: Integration of more sophisticated models for improved disease prediction capabilities.
